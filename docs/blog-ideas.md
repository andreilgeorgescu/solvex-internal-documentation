# Blog Ideas

## Technical
- Structural Recursion
- Iteration Levels
- Pure Functions & Referential Transparency
- FP vs. OOP
- Algebras
- Combinators
- Writing Semantically Meaningful Code
- Maps vs. Functions
- Why use abstractions/typeclasses?
    - Leads to less things to remember in the same language and with other languages
    - Allows you to start to see and understand more complex abstractions
    - Think more logically
    - Not always good (ie: Nothing to abstract, just one thing)
- Why use combinators?
    - We focus on functions
    - Basically pipes/railroads to how we want to process data
    - Elegant code that removes cruft and gets to the point
