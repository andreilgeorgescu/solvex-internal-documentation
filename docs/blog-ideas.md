# Blog Ideas

## Technical
- Structural Recursion
- Iteration Levels
- Pure Functions & Referential Transparency
- FP vs. OOP
- Algebras
- Combinators
- Writing Semantically Meaningful Code
- Maps vs. Functions
- Why use abstractions/typeclasses?
    - Leads to less things to remember in the same language and with other languages
    - Allows you to start to see and understand more complex abstractions
    - Think more logically
    - Not always good (ie: Nothing to abstract, just one thing)
    - allows for easier property based testing
- Why use combinators?
    - We focus on functions
    - Basically pipes/railroads to how we want to process data
    - Elegant code that removes cruft and gets to the point
- Using the right type vs maybe for partial functions
    - good examples: triples and division with 0
- Using Unit, Void, Either, or Tuple are code smells
    - They are the fundamental building blocks of ADTs
    - Thus using ADTs is almost always a better choice
    - ADTs add clarity, pattern matching, type safety, etc...
    - Tuple/Either can be seen as anonymous Product/Sum Types
- The expression problem
- Unit testing is not enough
- Property based testing removes the need for code coverage
- Removing uneccessary overhead
    - .gitignore
    - code coverage
    - CI/CD
    - Database creation/management/orm
    - dependencies
    - linter/formatter
